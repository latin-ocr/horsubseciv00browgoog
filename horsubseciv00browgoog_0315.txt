‘Oa l’m Wat, WatJ 30¹

Uncle impatiently.--‘Stuff ; “grateful l'' “pick up 1 '’
stuff l These word-mongers know nothing about it
Live, love; that is it, the perfect os live.’¹

After this, Uncle sent the cousins to their beds.
John's mother was in hers, never to rise from it again.
She was a widow, and Mary was her husband’s niece.
The house quiet, Uncle sat down in his chair, put
his feet on the fender, and watched the dying lire 3 it
had a rich central glow‚ but no dame, and no smoke,
it was flashing up fitsully, and bit by bit falling in.
He fell asleep watching it, and when he slept, he
dreamed. He was young; he was seventeen, he
was prowling about the head of North St. David
Street, keeping his eye on a certain door‚—we call

them common stairs in Scotland. He was waiting
sor Mr. White's famous English class for girls coming
out. Presently out rushed four or five girls, wild and
laughing; then came one, bounding like a roe:

‘ Such eyes were in her head,
And so much grace and power! '

She was surrounded by the rest, and away they went
laughing, she making them always laugh the more.

¹ They are strange beings, these lexioographers Richardson,
ior instance, under the word sNAIL, gives this quotation srorn
Beaumont and Fletcher's Wil al Several Weapons,
‘ Oh, Master Pompeyl how is 't, man?
elmon-Sumus, I'm almost started with love and eald, and
one thing or other.¹
Any one else knows of course that itis ‘⁹5 nails '-the contrac-
tion os the old oath or interjection-God's nat'ls.
