PREFACE.

QUEEZE out the whey‚' was the pithy and
³ sharp advice of his crusty, acute, faithful, and
ill-fated friend, William Taylor of Norwich, author

of English Synonyms‚ to Southey‚ when that com-

placent and indefatigable poet and literary man
of all work sent him the uss. of his huge quartos⁴
It would perhaps have been better for his fame had
the author of Tholabu, Dan Roderick, and The Curse
ofKehamu taken the gruff advice.

Iam going to squeeze my two volumes into one,
keeping it a profound secret as to what I regard as
whey and what curd ; only I believe the more pro·
fessional papers, as lecke and Sydenlzom, Dr. Mur-
slmll, etc, are less readable—less likely to while
away the idle hours of the gentle public, than those
now given: they are squeezed out not without a
giudge.

My energetic friend, J. T. Fields, of the well·
