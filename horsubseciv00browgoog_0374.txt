360 Horce Subsecivae.

At the Glasnock mill hae swat wi' sear,
An’ look'd roun’ sor Aiken·drurn‚

An’ guidly folks hae gotten a fricht‚
When the moon was set, an’ the stars gied nae licht‚
At the roaring linn in the howe 0' the nicht,

Wi' sughs like thilen-dmm

We would rather have written these lines than
any amount of Aurora Leighs, Festuses, or such
like, with all their mighty ‘somethingness,’ as Mr.
Bailey would say. For they, are they not the
‘native wood-notes wild' of one of nature's dar-
ingsl Here is the indescribable‚ inestimable, un-
mistakable impress of genius Chaucer, had he
been a Galloway man, might have written it, only
he would have been more garrulouS, and less com-
pact and stern. Itis like Tam 0' Shanter, in its
living union of the comic‚ the pathetic, and the ter-
rible. ShrewdnesS, tendemess, imagination, fancy,
humour, word-music, dramatic power, even wit-
all are here. I have often read it aloud to children,
and it is worth any one’s while to do it You will
find thern repeating all over the house for days such
lines as take their heart and tongue.

The author of this noble ballad was william
Nicholson, the Galloway poet, as he was, and is
still called in his own district He was born at
Tanimaus, in the parish of Borgue, in August 1783;
