going on. The expression of the then GreatUnknown
is very noble—he looks like a mighty shade ; beside
the bust is a terrier, such as only Sir Edwin can give,
with a keen look, as if he too smelt some one. Two
woodcocks are resting in front in a fold of the table-

stealthily peering from behind the tableeloth, is a
cat’s head, not yet seeing the game, but nosing it.

and express.
