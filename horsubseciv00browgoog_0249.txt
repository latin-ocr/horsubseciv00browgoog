But to retum to this most touching and impres-
sive picture. What an immediate hold it took of
us! How that sad family was in our mind sor
days after, and how we found ourselves wondering
if nothing could be done lor them! It is just
about as difficult to bring the mind to criticise it,
as it would be to occupy ourselves in thinking why
and how we were affected, is we were ourselves to
witness the scene in actual life. We would be
otherwise occupied. Our eyes first fell on what is
the immediate occasion of it all, the paper warrant;
you feel its sharp parallelogram cutting your retina,
it is the whitest‚ and therefore the first thing you see 3
and thenon the husband. What utter sadness‚—
what asober certainty of misery,-how uncomplain-
ing‚ as if he could not speak‚ his firm mouth keeping
it to himself l His eyes are all but shuts-how their
expression is given, seems to us quite marvellous;
and his attitude cast down, but not abject—bearing
it like a man. How his fingers are painted, and his
careless, miserable limbs‚ his thin cheek, with that
small hungry hollow mark in its centre! What a
dignity and beauty in his face! This is to us a finer
head than the wonderful one in Retzsch’s ‘Man
playing at Chess with the Devil for his Soul‚’ and
this is not saying little. Reason and steady purpose
are still uppermost

Not so with his poor wife : her heart is fast sailing;
