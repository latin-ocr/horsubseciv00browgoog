Dr. Chalmers. 119

But when we meet a salar man, of ample nature—
soul‚ body, and spirit ; when we find him from his
earliest years moving among his sellows like a king,
moving them whether they will or not-this feeling
of mystery is deepened ; and though we would not,
like some men (who should know better), worship
the creature and convert a hero into a god, we do
feel more than in other cases the truth, that it is the
inspiration of the Almighty which has given to that
man understanding, and that all power, all energy,
all light, come to him, from the First and the Last-
the Living One. God comes to be regarded by us,
in this instance, as He ought always to be, ‘the final
centre of repose'-the source of all being, of all lise
-the Terminus ad quem and the Terminus a quo.
And assuredly, as in the finnament that simple law
of gravitation reigns supreme—making it indeed a
kosmos-majestic, orderly, comely in its going-
ruling, and binding not the less the fiery and no-
madic cometa, than the gentle, punctual moons—so
certainly, and to us moral creatures to a degree
transcendently more important, does the whole intel-
ligent universe move around and move towards aud
in the Father of Lights

It would be well is the world would, among the
many other uses it makes of its great men, make
more of this—that they are manifestors os God——
revealers of His will-vessels of His omnipotente
