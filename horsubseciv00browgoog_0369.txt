lee Black Dwarf's Bonas. 3 5 ς

I have often thought that the Bromie, of whom
the south country legends are so full, must have been
some such misshapen creature, strong, willing and
forlorn, conscious of his hideous forbidding looks,
and ready to purchase affection at any eost os labour,
with a kindly heart, and a longing for human sym-
pathy and intercourse. Such a being looks like the
prototypo of the Aiken-Drum of our infancy‚ andos
’ that ‘drudgr'ng goblin‚’ of whom we all know how he

‘. . . . Sweat
To earn his ercam-bowl daily set, ,
When in one night, ere glimpse of morn,
His shadowy flail hath thresh'd the corn,
That ten day lab'rers could not end 3
Then lies him down, the lubber¹ flend,
And stretch'd out all the chimney's length,
Basks at the fire his hairy strength,
And cropful out os doors he flings,
Ere the first cock his marin rings’

My readers will, I arn sure, more than pardon me
tor giving thern the following poem on Aiken·Drum,
for the pleasure of first reading which, many years
ag0, Iarn indebted to Mr. R. Chambers’s Populm
Rlzymes of Scotlona', where its ‘extraordinary merit’
is generously acknowledged.

THE BROWNIE OF BLEDNOCH.

THERE cam' a strange wicht to our town-en',
An’ the fient a body did him ken ς
He tiri'd na lang, but he glided ben

Wi' a dreary, dreary hum.
