of form, of appearance, of texture, of weight, of all
the minute and deep philosophies of the touch and
of the other semes—the amount of this sort of
objective knowledge which every child of eight

the lap of nature and out of doors—and acquired
for life, is, if we could only think of it, marvellous
beyond any of our mightiest marches of intellect
Now, could we only get the knowledge of the
school to go as sweetly and decply and clearly
into the vitals of the mind as this sels-teaching has
done, and this is the paradisiac way of it, we should
make the young mind grow as well as leam, and
be in understanding a man as well as in simplicity
a child 3 we should get rid of much of that dreary,
sheer endurance of their school-hours-that stolid
lending of ears that do not hear—that objectless
looking without ever once seeing, and straining their
minds without an aim ; altemating, it may be, with
some scats of dexterity and effort, like a man trying
to list himself in his own arms, or take his head in
his 'teeth‚ exploits as dangerous, as ungracefu1‚and
as useless, except to glorify the showman and bring
wages in, as the feats of an acrobat

everybody must know how far the sun is from
'Georgium Sidus, and how much of phosphorus is in
our bones, and of ptyalin and flint in human spittle
