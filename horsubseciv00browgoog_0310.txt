great sacility ond dexterity of hand, much largeness
of quotation, and many material and mechanical
qualities‚ all go to form an amusing, and, it may be,
usesul spectacle‚ but not a true picture. We have
also, but not so often, the reverse of all this—the
vision without the faculty, the soul without the body,
great thoughts without the power to embody them in
intelligible forms. He, and he alone, is a great
palmer, and an heir of time, who combines both.
He must have observation,-humble, loving, unerr-
ing‚ unwearied ; this is the material out of which a
painter, like a poet, feeds his genius, and ‘makes
grow his wings.’ There must be perception and
conception, both vigemus, quick, and true: you
must have these two primary qualities‚ the one first,
the other last, in every great painter. Give him
good sense and a good memory‚ it will be all the
better for him and for us. As sor principles oi
drawing and perspective‚ they are not essential. A
mun who paints according te a principle is sure to
paint ill; he may apply his principles after his work
is done, if he has a philosophicas well as an ideal
turn.
