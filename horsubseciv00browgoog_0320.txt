‘Lanely nicht3' how much richer and more touching
’ than ‘darksome’ ‘Feather bcds are saft3' ‘pentit
rooms are bonnie ;' Ι would infer from this, that his
‘dearie‚' his ‘true love,' was a lass up at ‘the big
house'-a dapper Abigail possibly-at Sir Wil-

being very likely Thursday before day-break when
this affectionate ululatus ended in repose.

Now, is not this rude ditty, made very likely by
some clumsy, big-headed Galloway herd‚ full of 'the
real stuff of lovel He does not go off upon her
eye-brows, or even her eyes3 he does not sit down,
pand in a genteel way announce that ‘love in thine
eyes for ever sits,' etc. etc, or that her feet look

depth, the truth of his passion: it is not her eye-
lashes‚ or her nose, or her dimple‚ or even

‘A mole cinquespotted, like the crimson drops
I' the bottom of a cowslip‚'
