The above notice was published in 1851. On
sending to Mr. Hallam a copy of the Revieao in
which it appeared, I expressed my hope that he
would nothe displeased by what Ι had done. Ι
received the following kind and beautiful reply :—

‘wimou clusensi, Feb: 1, 1851.

‘DEAR SIR,—It would be ungratesul in me to feel any dis·
pleasure at so glowing an eulogy on my dear eldest son Arthur,
though after such a length os time, so unusual, as you have
written in the North Bn'tislt Revrerv. I thank you, on the con·
trary‚ for the strong language os admiration you have employed,
though it may expose me to applications sor copies of the Re·
moins‚ which I have it not in my power to comply with. Ι was
very desirous to have lent you a copy, at your request‚ but you
have succeeded elsewhere

‘You are probably aware that I was prevented from doing
this by a great ealamhy, very similar in its circumstances to that
l had to deplore in 1833-the loss os another son, equal in
virtues, hardly inferior in abilities, to him whom you have com·
-memorated This has been an unspeakable afflietion to me,
and at my advanced age, seventy-three years, Ι cau have no
resource but the hope, in God’s mercy, os a reunion with them
both. The resemblanee'in their characters was striking, andl
had often reflected how wonderfully my first loss had been re·
paired hythe substitution, as it might be called, of one so
closely representing his brother. 1 send you a briei Memoir‚
