was afterwards the mother of our Mary, and died in
giving her birth. She was Uncle Oldbuck’s first and
only sweetheart; and here was he, the only help our

Uncle awoke, the fire dead, and the room cold. He

‘ When thou art near me,
Sorrow seems to fly,
And then Ι think, as well Ι may,
That on this earth there is no ore
More blest than L

But when thou leay'st me,
Doubts and fears arise,
And darkness reigns,
Where all before was light
The sunshine of my soul
Is in those eyes,
And when they leave me
All the world is night.

But when thou art near me,
Sorrow seems to fly,

And then I feel, as well I may,

That on this earth there dwells not one
So blest as L’l
