138 Hora Subsecz'oae.

Dante, in Jeremy Taylor, in Milton, or in Burke; he
used it to emblazon his great centtal truths, to hang
clouds of glory on the skirts ol his illustrati0n; but it
was too passionate, too material, too encumbered
with images‚ too involved in the general mile‘e of the
soul, to do its work as a master. It was notin him,
as Thomas Fuller calls it, ‘that inward sense of the
soul, its most boundless and restless faculty3 for
while the understanding and the will are kept, as it
were, in liberd custoditi to their objects of verum et
bonum, it is free from all engagements—digs without
spade, flies without wings, builds without charges, in
a moment striding from the centre to the circum-
ferente of the world by a kind os omnipotency,
creating and annihilating things in an instant—rest-
less, ever working, never wearied! We may say,
indeed, that menos his temperament are not gener-
ally endowed with this power in largest measure; in
one sense they can do without it, in another they
want the conditions on which its highest exercise
depends. Plato and Milton, Shakspere and Dante
and Wordsworth, had imaginations tranquil, sedate,
cool, originative‚ penetrative, intense, which dwelt in
the ‘highest heaven of invention.' Hence it was that
Chalmers could personify or paint a passion; he
could give it in one of its actions3 he could not, or
rather he never did impassionate, create, and vivitya
person—a very different thing from personifyinga
