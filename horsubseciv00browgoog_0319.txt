‘oa J’m wat, was 305

wat' after a hard day’s work among the furrows or
on the hili. Tm walness of wat, wat, is as much
wetter than wet as a Scotch mist is more os a mist
than an English one ; and he is not only wat, wat,
but ‘weary,' longing sor a dry skin and a warm bed
and rest ; but no sooner said and felt, than, by the
law of contrast, he thinks on ‘Mysie’ or ‘Ailie,' his
Genevieve 3 and then ‘all thoughts, all passions, all
delights' begin to stir him, and ‘sain wad Ι rise and
rin’ (what a swistness beyond run is ‘rin' ἔ) Love
now makes him a poet3 the true imaginative power
enters and takes possession os him. By this time
his clothes are off, and he is snug in bed; nota
wink can he sleep 3 that ‘sain' is domineering over
him-and he breaks out into what is as genuine
passion and poetry‚ as anything from Sappho to
Tennyson-abrupt, vivid, heedless os syntan ‘Sim-
mer's a pleasant time! Would any os our greatest
geniuses, being limited to one word, have done
better than take ‘pleasantt’ and then the fine
vagueness os ‘time t’ ‘Flowers o’ every colour3'
he gets a glimpse of ‘herself a sairer flower‚' and
is off in pursuit. ‘The water rins ower the heugh'
(a steep precipice) 3 fiinging itself wiidly, passion-
ateiy over, and so do Ι long sor my tme lover.
Nothing can be simpler and finer than
‘WhenIsleep, Idream3 ’
When 1 wauk, I'm eerie’
