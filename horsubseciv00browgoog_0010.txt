known Boston firm, has done the same act of ex·
cision by the two volumes that Ι now d0,-and has
done it admirably. Only I could not but smile
when Ι saw Horoe Subseciooe exchanged for ‘Spare
Hours‚’-a good title, but not mine ; and my smile
broke into laughter when Ι found myself dedicated
‘affectionately’ to an excellent man and poet, whom,
to my sorrow, Ι do not know.

While thanking my American friends, and shaking
hands with them across the great deep, I cannot
deny myself the satisfaction of acknowledging the
following portion of a letter received a day or two
ago from an unknown friend—Charles D. Warner,
of Hartford, Coun, U.S. :—

‘I see you lay some stress upon the fact that your
venerated father was very tenacious of purpose, and
that that is a trait of the Browns. The branch of

the family in this country also assert the same of

themselves

‘In further reading how your father came, late in
life, when it was too late, to know that he had
neglected his body, Ι called to mind a remark of
another Dr. Brown, which Ι thought you might like
to hear, as confirmatory of your theory of the unity
of the Browns.
