408 Hora Subsecz'vae.

The lectures on the Affections, the Passions and
DesireS, and on Study, we would have everybody
to read and enjoy.

Sedgwick is a different, and, as a whole. an in-
ferior man 3 but a man every inch of him, and an
Englishman too, in his thoughts, and in his fine
mother wit and tongue. He has, in the midst of all
his confusion and passionateness, the true instinct
of philosophy-the true venatic sense of objective
truth. We know nothing better in the main, than
his demolition of what is untrue, and his reduction·
of what is absurd, and his taking the wind out of
what is tympanitic, in the notorious Vartzges,· we
don't say he always does justice to what is really
good in it 3 his mission is to execute justice upon it,
and that he does. His remarks on Oken and Owen,
and his quotations from Dr. Clarke’s admirable paper
on the Development eff tlte Fatus, in the Cambridge
Philosophical Transactzons, we would recommend to
our medical friends. The very confusion of Sedg-
wick is the free outcome os a deep and racy nature ;
it puts us in mind of what happened, when an Eng-
lishman was looking with astonishment and disgust
at a Scotchman eating a singed sheep’s head, and
was asked by the eater what he thought of that dishl
‘Bisa Sir, do you call that a dishl' ‘Dish or no
dish,’ rejoined the Caledonian, ‘there’s a deal 0’ fine
, confused seedin’ abootit let me tell you.'
