358 Horce Subsecz'vae.

An' to look at my sace in your clear crystal well,
Micht gie pleasure to Aiken·Drum.

‘I’se seek nae guids, gear, bond, nor mark 3

I use nae beddin', shoon, nor sark ;

But a cogfu' o’ brose ’tween the light an’ the dark,
Is the wege o’ Aiken-dmm’

Quoth the wylie auld wife, ‘The thing speaks weel 3

Our workers are scant—we hae routh 0’ 111111 ;

Gif he’ll do as he says-be he man, be he de'il,

An’ the fient 1 ane will the house come near,

‘Puir clipmalabors! ye hae little wit;

Is’t na hallowmas noo, an’ the crap out yet?'

Sae she seelenced them a' wi’ a stamp o' her fit,

Roun' a’ that side what wark was dune,
By the 5111111115 glemu, or the glauce o' the moon ;
A word, or a wish-an' the Brownie cam sune,

Sae helpfu’ was Aiken-dmm

But he slade aye awa or the sun was up,
He ne'er could look straught on Macmillan's cup :¹

'A communion cup, belonging to M‘Millan‚ the well-known ousted
minister os Balmaghie, and founder os the sect 11 Covenanters os his name„
This cup was treasured by a zealous disciple in the parish ο1 1111110111,
