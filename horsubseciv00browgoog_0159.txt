of the effect and beauty os these passages depends on
these names ; put others in their room, and try them.
We remember well our first hearing Dr. Chaimers.
We were in a moorland district in Tweeddale, re-
joicing in the country, aiter nine months oi the High
School. We heard that the famous preacher was to
be at a neighbouring parish church, and off we set,
a cartful of irrepressible youngsters. ‘Calm was all
nature as a'resting wheel.’ The crows, instead os
making wing, were impudent and sat still 3 the cart-
horses were standing, knowing the day, at the field-
gates, gossiping and garing, idle and happy ; the
moor was stretching away in the pale sunlight—
vast, dim, melancholy, like a sea; everywhere were
to be seen the gathering people‚ ‘sprinklings of
blithe company ς’ the country-side seemed moving
to one centre. As we entered the kirk we saw a
notorious character, a drover, who had much of the
brutal look of what he worked in, with the knowing
eye ofa man of the city, a sort of big Peter Bell—

‘ He had a hardness in his eye,
He had a hardness in his cheek’

He was our terror, and we not only wondered, but
were afraid when we saw him going in. The kirk
was full as it could hold. How different in looks
