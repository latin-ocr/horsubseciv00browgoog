I have heard that there was one kind of rose, his
καλλιστεῖον, which he was known to have given only
to three, and I remember seeing one of the three,
when she was past seventy. Margaret Murray, or
Morra, was her maiden name, and this fine old lady,
whom an Oxonian would call a Double First, grave
and silent, and bent with ‘the pains,' when asked
by us children, would, with some reluctance, and a
curious grave smile‚ produce out of her Bible, Bowed ·
Davie's withered and flattened rose: and from her
looks, even then, Ι was inclined to affirm the de-
cision of the connoisseur ol Manor Water. One can
fancy the scene in that sweet solitary valley, in-
formed like its sister Yarrow with pastoral melan-
choly, with a young May, bashful and eager, pre-
senting herself for honours, encounteriug from under
that penthouse of eyebrows the steady gaze of the
strange eldritch creature; and then his making up
his mind, and proceeding to pluck his award and
present it to her, ‘herself a fairer flower 3’ and then
turning with a scowl, crossed witha look of tender-
ness, crawl into his den. Poor ‘gloomy Dis,' slink·
ing in alone.

They say, that when the candidate came, he sur-
veyed her from his window, his eyes gleamiug out of
the darkness, and if he liked her not, he disappeared ;
il he would entertain her, he beckoned her into the
garden.
