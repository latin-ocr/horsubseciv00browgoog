might think, uncouth, and imperfect, and incorrect:
chiefly owing to his temperament, to his tiery, im-
patient, swelling spirit, this gave his orations their
tine audacity—this brought out hot from the fumace,
his new words—this made his numbers run wild-
lege solutis. We are sure this view will be found con-
firmed by these ‘ Daily Readings,' when he wrote
little, and had not time to get heated, and when the
nature of the work, the honr at which it was done,
and his solitariness, made his thoughts fiow at their
‘own sweet will ;' they are often quite as classical in
expression, as they are deep and lucid in thought-
reflecting heaven with its clouds and starS, and letting
us see deep down into its own secret depths : this is

heard and believed; and he did it much in the same way, and
in the same words, sor the thoughts and affections and posture
os his soul were the same. Like all men os vivid perception
and keen sensibility, his mind and his body continued under im·
pressions, both material and spiritual, after the objects were
gone A curious instance ot' this occurs to us. Some years
ago, he roamed up and down through the woods near Auchin·
dinny, with two boys as companions. It was the first burst of
summer, and the trees were more than usually enriched with
leaves. He wandered about delighted, silent, looking at the
leaves, ‘thick and numberless’ As the three went on, they
came suddenly upon a high brick wall, newly built, for peach
trees, not yet planted. Dr. Chalmers halted, and looking
steadfastly at the wall, exclaimed most earnestly, ‘What foliage!
what solingel' The boys looked at one another, and said no·
thing5 but on getting home, expressed their astonishment at
this very puzzling phenomenorn What a difference! leaves
and parallelograms ; a forest and a brick wall!
