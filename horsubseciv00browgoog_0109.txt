Letter to John Cairns, DJ). 93

double and being all the lighter of it It is an old
story now, but it was new then: a big, perspiring
countryman rushed into the Black Bull coachoffice,
and holding the door, shouted, ‘Are yir insides a’ ootl'
This was my first tasting of the flavour of a joke.

Had Dr. Heugh, instead of being the admirable
clergyman he was, devoted himself to public civil life,
and gone into Parliament, he would have taken a high
place asa debater, a practical statesman and patriot.
He had many of the best qualities of Canning‚ and
our own Premier, with purer and higher qualities than
either. There is no one our church should be more
proud of than of this beloved and excellent man, the
holiness and humility, the jealouS, godly fear in whose
nature was not known fully even to his friends till he
was gone, when his private daily sels-searchings and
prostrations before his Master and Judge were for the
first time made known. There are few characters,
both sides of which are so unsullied‚ so pure, and
without reproach.

I am back at Biggar at the old sacramental times 3
l see and hear my grandfather, or Mr. Horne of

Braehead, Mr. Leckie of Peebles Mr. Harper of ·

Lanark, as inveterate in argument as he was warrn
in heart, Mr. Comrie of Penicuik, with his keen,
Voltaire-like face, and much of that unhappy and
unique man’s wit, and sense, and perfection of ex-
pression, without his darker and baser qualities. l
