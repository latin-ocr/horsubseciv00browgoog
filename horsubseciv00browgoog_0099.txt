Letfer fo John Cairns, DjD 8 3

Sir John anxious and gracious. Dr. Belfrage, like,
I believe, every other minister in his body, wasa
thoroughgoing Liberal, what was then called a Whig3
but partly from his natural sense of humour and relish
of power, and partly, I believe, for my benefit, he was
putting the Baronet through his facings with some
strictness, opening upon him startling views, and end-
ing by asking him, ‘Are you, Sir John, for free-trade
in corn, free-trade iu education, free-trade in religioni
Iam! Sir John said, ‘Well, doctor, Ι have heard
of free-trade in com, but never in the other two’
‘You’ll hear of them before ten years are gone, Sir
John, or I'm mistahen.'

Ι have said thus much of this to mc memorable
man, not only because he was my father's closest and
most powerful personal friend, but because by his
word he probably changed the whole future course
of his life. Devotion to his friends wasone of the
· chief ends of his life, not caring much for, and having
in the affection of his heart a warning against the
perils and excitement of distinction and energetic
public work, he set himself far more strenuously than
for any selfish object, to promote the triumphs of
those whom his acquired instinct-for he knew a man
as a shepherd knows a sheep, or ‘ Caveat Emptor' a
horse-pieked out as' deserving them. He rests in
Colinton churchyard,

‘Where all that mighty heart is lying still‚’-
