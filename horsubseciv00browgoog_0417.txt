books we have named at the end of this paper.
We recommend them all to our young readers.
Arnauld’s excellent and entertaining Art of Think-

little book is admirable, and is specially suited for
a medical student, as its illustrations are drawn
with great intelligence and exactness from chemis

strong style. We can only give some short extracts.
