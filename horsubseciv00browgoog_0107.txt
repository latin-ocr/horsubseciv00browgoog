Lelter to John Coz‘rns, BD. 91

His was essentially a practical understanding; he was
a man os action, aman for men more than for man,
the curious reverse in this of my father. He de-
lighted in public life, had a native turn for affairs, for
all that society needs and demands-clearheaded,
ready, intrepid, adroit3 with a fine temper, but keen
and honest, with an argument anda question and a
joke for every one ; not disputatious, but delighting
in a brisk argument, fonder of wrestling than os
fencing, but ready for action ; not much of a long
shot, always keeping his eye on the immediate, the
possible,the attainable, but in all this guided by
genuine principle, and the finest honour and ex-
actest truth. He excelled in the conductos public
business, saw his way clear, made other men see
theirs, was for ever getting the Synod out os diffi-
culties and confusions, by some clear, tidy, conclusive
‘motion 3’ and then his speaking, so easy and bright
and pithy, manly and gentlemanly, grave when it
should be, never when it should not—mobile, sear-
less, rapid, brilliant as Saladin—his silent, pensive,
impassioned and emphatic friend was more like the
lion-hearted Richard‚ with his heavy mace, he might
miss, but let him hit, and there needed no repetition.
Each admired the other ; indeed Dr. Heugh's love of
my father was quite romantic3 and though they were
opposed on several great public questions, such as
the Apocrypha controversy, the Atonentent question
