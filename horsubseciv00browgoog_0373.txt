T lae Black Dwarf’s Bonas. 3 59

They watch’d-but nane saw him his brose ever sup, Ι
Nor a spune sought Aikendrurn

On Blednoch banks‚ an’ on crystal Cree,

For mony a day a toil'd wicht was he;

And the bairns they play'd harmless roun’ his knee,
Sae social was arken-druna

But a new-made wile, su' o' rippish lreaks,

Fond 0’ a' things seat sor the five first weeks,

Laid a mouldy pair o' her ain man’s brceks
By the brose o’ Ailrendrum.

Let the learn'd decide when they convene,
v What spell was him an' the breeks between 3
For frae that day forth he was nae mair seen,

An’ sair miss’d was Aiken-dnrrn.

He was heard by a herd gaun by the Thrieve,
Crying, ‘Lang‚ lang now may Ι greet an’ grieve3
For alas! I hae gotten balth see an' leave,

O luckless Aikendrum !'

Awa! ye wrangling sceptic tribe,

Wi' your pro’s an’ your con’s wad ye decide

'Gainst the ’sponsible voice o' a hale country-side
On the facts ’bout Aikendrum?

Tho’ the ‘Brownie o' Blednoch’ lang be gane,
The mark o' his seet’s left on mony a stane3
An' mony a wise an' mony a wean

Tell the feats o' Ailrendnrm?

E’en now, licht loons that gibe an’ sneer
At spiritual guests an' a’ sic gear,

and long used as a test by which to ascertain the orthodoxy os suspected per·
sons. Il, on taking it into his hand, the person trembled‚ or gave other
symptoms of agitation, he was denounced as having bowed the knee to
Baal, and sacrificed at the altar os idolatry.
