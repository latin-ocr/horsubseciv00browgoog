‘Sure, we are leaves os one harmonious bower,
Fed by a sap that never will be scant,
All-penneating, all-producing mind ;

And in our several parcellings os doom

We but sulfil the beauty of the whole,

Oh, madness! if a leaf should dare complain
Os its dark verdure, and aspire to be

The gayer, brighter thing that wantons near!

‘Oh, blessing and delight os my young beart,
Maiden, who wast so lovely, and so pure,
1 know not in what region now thou art,
Or whom thy gentle eyes in joy assure. ·
Not the old hills on which we gazed together,
Not the old faces which we both did love,
Not the old books, whence knowledge we did gather,
Not these, but others now thy fancies move.

“ I would I knew thy present hopes and fears,
All thy companions with their pleasant talk,
And the clear aspect which thy dwelli'ng weats :
So, though in body absent, I might walk
With thee in thought and feeling, till thy mood
Did sanctify mine own to peerless good!

‘Alfred I would that you beheld me now,
sitting beneath a mossy ivied wall

’ On a quaint bench, which to that structure old
Winds an accordant curve. Above my head
Dilates rinmeasumble a wild ofleavcs,
Seeming received into the blue expanse
That vaults this summer noon’

⁶ still here—thou hast not saded from my sight,
Norall tlte music mund thee fnmr mine ear ,·
Still grace florus from thee to the bnghteningyeag
¹ And all the binis laugh autin woalthier light.
