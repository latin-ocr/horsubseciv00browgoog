Wasp. 201

mental and bodily happiness and relief when they
were pulling away—and theirs

On one occasion* my brother had lent her to a¹
woman who lived in a lonely house, and whose
husband was away for a time. She was a capital
watch. One day an Italian with his organ came-
first begging, then demanding money-showing that
he knew she was alone, and that he meant to help
himself, if she didn't. She threatened to ‘lowse the
dowg3’ but as this was Greek to him, he pushed
on. She had just time to set Wasp at him. It was
very short work. She had him by the throat‚ pulled
him and his organ down with a heavy crash‚ the
organ giving a ludicrous sort of cry of musical pain.
Wasp5 thinking this was from some creature within,
possibly a whiltret, left the ruffian, and set to work
tooth and nail on the box. Its master slunk off,
and with mingled fury and thankfulness‚ watched
her disembowelling his only means of an honest
living. The woman good-naturedly took her off,
and signed to the miscreant to make himself and
his remains scarce. This he did with a scowl; and
was found in the evening in the village, telling a
series of lies to the watchmaker, and bribing him
with a shilling to mend his pipes—‘his kist 0¹
whussels.'
