Notas on Art. 2⁶9

and yet not being vacant—this irresolute and help
less look in one so resolute, so aelf-sustained, is to us
one of the very highest results of that art which
affects the mind through the eye.

The picture, as a work of art, is remarkable for
its simplicity of idea and treatment, the severity
of its manner, and the gloomy awfulness everywhere
breathing from it It seems to gather darkness as
you gaze at it 3 the imperial eagles emblazoned on
the wall are struggling through a sort of ruddy dark-
ness produced by the deep shadow on the rich-
coloured curtain. His sword is lying on a table, its
hilt towards us.

But what impressed us most, and what still irn-
presses us is, that we have seen the man as he then
was, as he then was looking, and thinking, feeling,
and suffering. We started at first as if we were
before him, rather than he before uS, and that we
would not like to have that beautiful but dread coun-
tenance, and those unsearchable, penetrating cold
eyes lifted up upon us.

No man need ask himself after this, if Delaroehe
is a great artist; but some of his other works display,
if not more intensity, more variety of idea and ex-
pression. Their prevailing spin't is that of severe
truthfulnesS, simplicity, and a kind of gloomy power
-a certain awfulnesS, in its strict sense, not going
up to sublimity perhaps, or forward into beauty.
