true sense, Ι do not again expect to see. On the
morning of his death he said to me, ‘Johu, come and
tell me honestly how this is to end; tell me the last
symptoms in their sequence’ I knew the man, and
was honest, and told him all I knew. ‘Is there any
chance of stupor or deliriuml' ‘I think not. Death
(to take Bichat’s division) will begin at the heart
itself, and you will die conscious.' ‘I am glad of
that. It was Samuel Johnson, wasn’t it, who wished
not to die unconscious, that he might enter the
etemal world with his mind unclouded3 but you
know, John, that was physiological nonsense. We
leave the brain, and all this ruined body, behind 3
but I would like to be in my senses when Ι take my
last look of this wonderful world,' looking across the
still sea towards the Argyleshire hilis, lying in the,
light of sunrise‚ ‘and of my friends—of you‚’ fixing
his eyes on a faithful friend and myself. And it was
so; in less than an hour he was dead, sitting erect
in his chair—his disease had for weeks prevented
him from lying down,-—all the dignity, simplicity,
and benignity of its master resting upon, and, as it
were, supporting that ‘ruin,’ which he had left.

I cannot end this tribute to my fathers friend and
mine, and my own dear and earliest friend's father,
without reeording one of the most extraordinary
instanoes of the power of will, under the pressure of
affection, I ever witnessed or heard of. Dr. Belfrage
