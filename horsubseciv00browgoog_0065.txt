Leller lo John cairus, OD. 49

delighted to possess books which any of them might
have held in their hands, on which they had written
their names. He had a number of these, some very
curious ; among others, that wild soldier, man of
faslrion and wit among the reformers, Ulric von
Hiitten’s autograph on Erasmus' beautiful solio Greek
Testament‚ and John Howe’s (spelt How) on the first
edition of Milton’s Speech on Unlicensed Printing.¹
He began collecting books when he was twelve, and
he was collecting up to his last hours. He eared
least for merely fine books, though he enjoyed, no
one more se, fine· type, good binding, and all the
niceties of the book-fancier. What he liked were
such books as were directly useful in his work, and
such as he liked to live in the midst of, such, also,

Erasmus (very like ‘Uncle Ebenezer')—John Knox-Dr.
Waugh-John Milton (three, all lramedl—Dr. Dick—Dr. Hall
-Lutlrer (twol-Dr. Heugh-Dr. Mitehell-Dr. Balmer-Dr.
Henderson—Dr. Wardlaw-Shakspere (a small oil painting
which he had since ever Ι rememberl—Dugald Stewart—Dr.
lnnes-Dr. Smith, Biggar-the two Erskines and Mr. Fisher—
Dr. John 'l'aylor ol Torento-Dr. Chalmers—Mr. William

M‘Lean—Dr. John Erskine-—Tholuck—John Pym—Gesenius
—Prosessor Finlayson—Richard Baxter—Dr. Lawson-Dr.
Peddie (two, and a copy os Joseph’s noble bust); and they
were thus all about him sor no other reason than that he liked
to look at and think os them through their countenances

¹ In a copy os Baxter’s Life and TimeS, which he picked up
at Maurice Ogle's shop in Glasgow, which had belonged to
Anna, Countess of Argyll, besides her autograph, there isa most
affecting and interesting note in that venerahle lady's handwrir·
