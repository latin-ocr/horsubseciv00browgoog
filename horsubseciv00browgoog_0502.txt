RAB ΛΝΒ HIS FRIENDS.

⁴ his Friends‚’' that these friends are os human kind, and that the ,-
success of the tale depends even more on the interest which the ¹
carrier and his wise excite than on the doings of their faithful
dog. The tale moves from the most tragic pathos to the most
reekless humour, and could not have been written but hya man
of tine genius Whether it moves tears or laughter, it isperlect
in its way, and immortalizes its author. ’- Timar.

‘Who is he that has not heard of is not read, “ Rab and
his Friends?” We suppose that there have been few storias
ever printed which, in so short a time, won sor their author same
Certainly never was a story so short and so pathetic‚ so fullos
joyous tears, so brimming with the actions from which spring
sacred pity. We do not envy the man, and we cannot imagine
the woman or girl who could read the story os “Rab and his
Friends” without tears actual or imminent. Yet ‚is not the
tale grievous 3 it does not wound the feelings‚ it merely touches
the heart ; it is, too, but a sketch, which could never have been
made a painting without tlre loss of its chiesest charms “ Rab
and his Friends” has now been published ina separate form,
with seven illustrations engraved in the highest style of art,
from sketches by Mr. George Harvey, Mr. Noel Paron, and
Mrs Blackbum, these, and especially the frontispiece,—Jers
in her Stable‚ Rab’s Grave, and his Companions‚-are worthy
of the story, which is printed on beautiful paper, and is
bound with exquisite simplicity. To almost 'any woman, but
especially to a girl in the middle of her'teens,'there could not
bea more acceptable present than “ Rab and his Friends ” in
its present form '—M0rning Herald.

‘The present reprint of this painsul and touching story is
beautifully illustrated by seve'ral hands It is almost invidious
to particularize where all are so good, but the sketches we ad·
mire most are the exquisite paysageentitled “ Rab's Grave,'‘ and
the final group (by Georg'e Harvey) of little children, among
whom are his own daughter and one os the authoffs‘—Econa
mist.
