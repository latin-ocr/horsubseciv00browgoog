had made out of the fifty-third chapter of his favour·
ite prophet, the, princely Isaiah¹ Even then, so far
as Ι can recal, he never took notes of what he read.
He did not need this, his intellectual force and clear·

the Living Temple, ‘bearing on its front this doleful inscrip-

‘His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, the mighty
God,’ bya peremptory, explosive sharpness, as of thunder over·

now given to Handel's music, and doubtless so meant by him ;

man who wishes to feel Isaiah, as wellas understand him, should
be ignorant of Handel’s ‘Messiah' His prelude to ‘Comfort
ye ’-its simple theme, cheersul and infinite as the ripple of the
unsearchable sea—gives a deeper meaning to the words. One
of my father's great delights in his dying months was reading the
lives of Handel and Michael Angelo, then newly out. He felt
that the author of ‘He was despised,' and ‘He shall feed his

religious feeling, of which they were the utterance; and he re·
joiced over the warlike airs and choruses of ‘Judas Maccabaeus.’
Y ou have recorded his estimare of the religious nature of him of
the terribile via .· he said it was a relief to his mind to know that
such a mighty genius walked humbly with his God.
