has kept this strange world of ours from being ten-

‘Ring out the old, ring in the new,
Ring happy bells across the snow,
The year is going, let him go ;

Ring out the salse, ring in the true

‘Ring out a slowly dying cause,
And ancient forms ol party striie;
Ring in the nobler forms os lile,
With sweeter manners, purer laws

‘Ring out false pride in place and blood,
Τὴε civic slander and the spite ;
'Ring in the love oi truth and right,

Ring in the common love os good.

‘Ring out old shapes of ioul disease,
Ring out the narrowing lust oi gold 3
Ring out the thousand wars ol old,

Ring in the thousand years os peace’
