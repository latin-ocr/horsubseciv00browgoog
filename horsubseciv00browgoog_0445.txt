Artlmr H. Hallam. 431

‘The Latin poetry of 'an Etonian is generally
reckoned at that School the chief test of his literary
talent. That of Arthur was good without being
excellent ; he never wanted depth of thought, or
truth of feeling3 but it is only in a few rare in-
stances,if altogether in any, that an original mind
has been known to utter itself freely and vigor-
ously, without sacrifice of purity, in a language the
capacities of which are so imperfectly underst00d;
and in his productions there was not the thorough
conformity to an ancient model which is required
for perfect elegance in Latin verse. He took no
great pleasure in this sort of composition 3 and
perhaps never returned to it of his own accord.

‘In the latter part of his residence at Et0n‚ he was
led away more and more by the predominant bias of
his mind, horn the exclusive study of ancient litera-
ture. The poets of England, especially the older
dramatistS, came with greater attraction over his
spirit. He loved Fletcher, and some of Fletcher's
contemporaries, for their energy of language and
intenseness of feeling 3 but it was in Shakspere
alone that he found the fulness of soul which
seemed to slake the thirst of his own rapidly ex-
panding genius for an inexhaustible fountain ot
thought and ernotion. He knew Shakspere tho
roughly 3 and indeed his acquaintance with the
earlier poetry of this country was very extensive.
