pared the soil from which the chief nutriment of the
goodly tree, our British oak, must be derived, l am
yet proud to consess that Ι look with sentiments
more exulting and more reverential to the bonds
by which the law of the universe has fastened me
to my distant brethren of the same Caucasian racc,
to the privileges which I, an inhabitant ol the gloomy
North, share in common with climates imparadised
in perpetual summer, to the universality and efficacy
