Ι refer my readers to what he says on Ἀγχίνοια and
Εὐσίὀχίω1

My object in what I have now written and arn
going to write, is to impress upon medical students
the value of power and promptitude in combination,
for their professional purposes ; the uses to them of
neamess of the Νοῦς, and of happy guessing3 and
how you may see the sense, and neatness, and pith

¹As I arn now, to my sorrow and shame, too much of a
mediate Grecian, I give a Balliol sriend’s note on these two
words :—‘What you have called “presence oi mind ” and
“happy guessing'’ may, 1 think, be identified respectively with
Aristotle’s ἀγχίνοια and εὐστοχία, The latter of these, coare»
ιχία, Aristotle mentions incidentally when treating os εὐβουλία,
or good deliberation. Eth. Nic. blr. vr. ch. 9. Good delibera·

the same passage he tells us that ἀγχίνοια is a sort of εὐστοχίσ.
'But he speaks of ἀγχίνοια more fully in Ana. Post. 1. 34 :—
“dyxlworn is a sort os happy gnessing at the intermediam,
when there is not time ior consideration: as when a man, seeing
that the bright side of the moon is always turned towards the
sun, comprehends that her light is borrowed from the sun; or
concludes, from seeing one conversing with a capitalist that he
wants to borrow money ; or infers that people are friends from
the fact of their having common enemies” And then he goes
on to make these simple observations confused nod perplexing
by reducing them to his logical formula.

‘The derivation of the words will confirm this view. nrm·
χία is a hitting the mark successfully, a reaching to the end,
the rapid, and, as it were, intuitive perception oi the truth.
This is what Whewell means by saying, “all induction is a
happy conjecture.” But when Aristotle says that this faculty
is not guided by reason (duco τε γὰρ λόγον), he does not menn
