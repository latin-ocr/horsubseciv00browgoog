Latiar to Jolm Cazrns, DJ). 63

wherever and in whomsoever it was found—Pagan
or Christian, Romanist or Protestant, bond or free,
and while he disliked, and had indeed a positive
antipathy to intellectual mysticism, he had a great
knowledge of and relish for such writers as Dr.
Henry More, Culverwel, Scougall‚ Madame Guyon,
whom (besides their other qualities) I may perhaps
be allowed to call affectionate mystics, and for such
poets as Herbert and Vaughan, whose poetry was
pious‚ and their piety poetic. As I have said, he was
perhaps too impatient of all obscure thinking, from
not considering that on certain subjects, necessarily
in their substance, and on the skirts of all subjects,

understood to mean that—nothing but love-crosses are going,
and that no tolerable amount of comfort or happiness is to be
found in the life matrimonial, or in any oi the approaches to·
wards it Every intelligent student of Shakspere, however, will
at once feel that the poet’s mind speedily passes away from the
idea with which he starts, and becomes merged in a far wider
theme, via, in the disenchantment to which all lofty imagina-
tions are liable, the disappointment to which all extravagant
earthly hopes and wishes are doomed. This, in fact, is dis·
tinctly expressed in the last line, and in this sense alone oan the
words be regarded as at all touching or impressive. Sudden
expansions and transitions of thought, then, are nothing more
than what is common to all poetry; and when we find the
Hebrew bards, in their prophetie songs, mingling in the closest
conjunction the anticipations of the glories of Solomon’s reign,
or the happy prospects of a return from Babylon, with the
higher glory and happiness of Messiah's advent, such transi·
tions of thought are in perfect accordance with the ordinary laws
of poetry, and ought not to perplex even the most unimaginative
student of the Bible'
