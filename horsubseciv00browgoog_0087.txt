then bite. One evening I had lilted both these
worthies, by the ears of course, and was taking them
from their clover to their beds‚ when my grandfather,

to please me.

He was for ever doing good in his quiet yet eamest
way. Not only on Sunday when he preached solid
gospel sermons, full of quaint and familiar expres·
sions, such as Ι sear lew of my readers could take up,
full of solemn, affectionate appeals‚ full of his own
simplicity and love, the Monday also found him ready
with his everyday gospel. If he met adrover from
Lochaber who had crossed the Campsie Hills, and
was making across Camwath Μοοτ to the Calstane
Slap‚ and thence into England by the drove-mad, he
accosted him with a friendly smile,-gave him a
reasonable tract, and dropped into him some words
of Divine truth. He was thus continuolly doing good.
Go where he might, he had his message to every one 3
to a servant lass, to a poor wanderer on the bleak
streets, to gentle and simple-he flowed for ever
pleno rivo.
