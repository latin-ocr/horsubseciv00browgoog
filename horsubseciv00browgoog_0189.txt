QUEEN MARY’S CHILD-GARDEN.

F any one wants a pleasure that is sure to please‚
one over which he needn't growl the sardonic
beatitude of the great Dean, let him, when the Mer-
cury is at ‘Fair,' take the nine nm. train to the
North, and a return ticket sor Callander‚ and when
he arrives at Stirling let him ask the most obliging
and knowing os station-masters t0 telegraph to ‘the
Dreadnought' for a carriage to be in waiting. When
passing Dunblane Cathedral, let him resolve to write
to the Scntsman‚ advising the removal of a chuple ol‘
shabby trees which obstruet the view of that beautiful
tn‘ple end-window which Mr. Ruskin and everybody
else admires, and by the time he has written this
letter in his mind, and turned the sentences to it, he
will find himself at Callander and the carriage all
ready. Giving the order lor the Part cy‘ Monteitln
he will rattle through this hard-featured‚ and to our
eye comfortless village, lying ugly amid so much

grandeur and beauty‚ and let him stop on the crown
