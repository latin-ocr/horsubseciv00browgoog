as Sydney, Locke, or old Hollis. For instance, his
admiration of Lord Macaulay as a writer and aman
of letters, an orator and a statesman, great as it was,
was as nothing to his gratitude to him for having
placed permanently on record, beyond all risk of

religious independence of every one but his Maker‚
were the two elements in building up his beliefs on

kindness in favouring me with a sight of the volume of Baxter’s
Life, which formerly belonged to my ancestrix, Anna, Countess
of Argyll. The MS. note inserted byherin it respecting her
daughter is extremely interesting. lhad always been under the
impression that the daughter had died very shortly after her re·
moval to France, but the contrary appears from Lady Argyll's
memorandum. That memorandum throws also a pleasing light
on the later life of Lady Anna, and sorcibly illustrates the un·

been very old when shepenned it, the book having been printed
as late as 1696.

1 am extremely obliged to you for communicating to me this
new and very interesting information-Believe me, my dear Sir,
your much obliged and faithful servant,
