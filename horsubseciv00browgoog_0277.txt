Notas on Art. 263

tint of the sky, the cold splendour on the mountain
tops, and the gloom in the corries, we know that day
is fast going, and night with all her fears drawing on,
and what is to become of that young desolate thingl

This is not a picture to be much spoken about3 it
is too quick with tenderness, and reaches too nicely
that point which just stops short os sadness3‘ words
would only mar its pathetic touch.

Here is another by the same painter, which, though
inferior and very different in subject, is not less admi-
rable in treatment It consists of the portraits ol
three sporting dogs. A retriever, with its sonsy and
affectionate visage, holding gingerly in its mouth a
living woodcock, whose bright and terror-stricken
eye is painted to the life. In the centre is a keen
thoroughgoing pointer, who has just found the scent
among the turnips. This is perhaps the most mas-
terly among the three, for colour and for expression
The last is a livercoloured spaniel, panting overa
plump pheasant, and looking to its invisible master
for applause. The touch of genius is over them all,
everywhere, frorn the rich eye of the retriever to the
wasted tumip-leaves Yet there is no mere clever-
ness, no traces of handiwork 3 you are not made to
think of work at all, till you have got your fill of
pleasure and surprise, and then you wonder what
cunning brain, and eye, and finger could 'have got
so much out of so little,¹ and so common.
