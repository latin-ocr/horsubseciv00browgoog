petual misery of many individuals as incompatible
with sovereign love!

‘In the Supreme Nature those two capacities of
Perfeet Love and Perfect Joy are indivisible. Holi-
ness and Happiness, says an old divine, are two
several notions of one thing. Equally inseparable
arethe notions of Opposition to Love and Opposi-
tion to Bliss. Unless therefore tlte heortof o created
beingis ot one witta tlte leeort os Goo', it cannot but be
miseroble. Moreover‚ there is no possibility of con-
tinuing for ever partly with God and partly against
him: we must either be capable by our nature oi
entire accordance with His will, or we must be in·
capable of anything but misery‚ further than He may
for awhile “not impote our trespasses to us‚'' that is,
He may interpose some temporary barrier between
sin and its attendant pain. For in the Eternol Ideo
os Goo' o created spirit is perhaps not seen, os o series
eff successive states, of which some that are evil might
be compensated by others that are good, botos one
indioz'sible object os these almost infinitely diozst'ble
modes, and that either in accordance with His own
nature, or in opposition to it. . . .

‘Before the gospel was preached to man, how
could a human soul have this love, and this consec
quent lifel I see no way; but now that Christ has
excited our love sor him by showing unutterable love
lor us; now that we know him as an Elder Brother.
