420 H orae Subsecivoe.

‘Break, break, break,
On thy cold grey stenes, Ο sea!

And I would that my tongue could utter
Τὴε thoughts that arise in me.

ιΟ well sor the fisherman’s boy,

That he shouts with his sister at play!
Ο well sor the sailor lad

That he sings in his boat on the bay!

‘ And the stately ships go on
To their haven under the hill!
But O sor the touch oi a vanish'd hand,
And the sound ol a voice that is still!

than the affectionate conditions, under which such a record as
In Memoriam is produced, and may give us more insight into
the imaginativc faculty's mode of working, than all our philo·
sophizing and analysis. It seems to let out with the sulness,
simplicity, and unconsciousness of a child-⁸ Fancys Child’-
the secret mechanism or procession of the greatest creative mind
our race has produced. In itseli, it has no recondite meaning,
it answers fully its own sweet purpose. We are not believers,
like some folks, in the omniscience oi even Shakspere
But, like many things that he and otherwise men and many
simple children say, it has agenn of universal meaning, which
it is quite lawlul to bring out oi it, and which may be en·
joyed to the lull without any wrong to its own original beauty
and fitness. A dev-drop is not the less beautiful that it
illustrates in its structure the law os gravitation which holds the
world together, and by which ‘the most ancient heavens are
fresh and strong) This is the passage. Τ1ιε Fn‘ar speaking os
Claudio, hearing that Hero ‘died upon his words,' says-

‘The idea os her life shall sweetly creep

Into his study of iinagination :

And every lovely organ os her lise

Shall come apparelled in more precious habit-

More moving delicate, and full of life,

Into the eve and prospect os his soal,
‘l'han when she lived indeed)
