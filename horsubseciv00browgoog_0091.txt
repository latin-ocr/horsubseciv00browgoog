Letter to John Caz'rns, OB. 7 ς

tion and blunt speech—‘ Puir auld man, what brocht
ye here in sic a dayl’ There they were, a rough
crew‚ surrounding the saintly man, some putting on
his hat, sorting and eheering him, and others knock-
ing the balls off the pony's feet, and stuffing them
with grease. He was most polite and grateful, and
one of these cordial ruffians having pierced a cask,
brought him a horn of whisky, and said, ‘Tak that,
it'll hearten ye.’ He took the hom, and bowing to
them, said, ‘Sirs‚ let us give thanks l' and there, by
the mad-side, in the drift and storm‚ with these wild
fellowS‚ he asked a blessing on it, and for his kind
deliverers, and took a tasting of the horn. The men
‘cried like children. They lifted him on his pony‚ one
going with him, and when the rest arrived in Inver-
keithing, they repeated the story to everybody‚ and '
broke down in tears whenever they came to the
blessing. ‘And to think o’ askin’ a blessin’ ona
tass o’ whisky l’ Next Presbytery day, aster the ordi-
nary business was over, he rose up—he seldom spoke
-and said, ‘Moderator, Ι have something personal
to myself to say. I have often said, that real kind-
ness belongs only to true Christians, but’—and then
he told the story of these men; ‘but more true
kindness Ι never experienced than from these lads.
They may have had the grace os God, I don't know3
but I never mean again to be so positive in speaking
of this matter!
