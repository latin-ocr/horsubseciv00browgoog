I think every family should have a dog ; it is like
having a perpetual baby ; it is the plaything and crony
of the whole house. It keeps them all young. All
unite upon Dick. And then he tells no tales, betrays
no secrets, never sulks, aslis no troublesome ques·
tions, never gets into debt‚ never coming down late
for breakfast, or coming in by his Chubb too early to
bed-is always ready for a bit of fun, lies in wait for
it, and you may, if choleric‚ to your relies, kick him
instead of some one else, who would not take it so
meekly‚ and, moreover, would certainly not, as he
does, ask your pardon sor being kicked.

Never put a collar on your dog—it only gets him
stolen 3 give him only one meal a day, and let that,
as Darne Dorothy, Sir Thomas Browne's wife, would
say, be ‘rayther under! Wash him once a week,
and always wash the soap out3 and let him be care-
fully combed and brushed twice a week,

By the bye, I was wrong in saying that it was
Bums who said Man is the god of the Dog-he got
it from Bacon’s Essay on Arietem, or perhaps more
truly-Baeon had it first.
