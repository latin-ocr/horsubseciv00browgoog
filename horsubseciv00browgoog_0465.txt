society at Trinity College, or in one to which he
afterwards belonged in London. That entitled Theo-
dicaeu Noutrsima, is printed at the desire of some of
his intimate friends. A few expressions in it want
his usual precision 3 and there are ideas which he
might have seen cause, in the lapse of time, to¹
modify, independently of what his very acute mind
would probably have perceived‚ that his hypothesis,
like that of Leibnitz, on the origin os evil, resolves
itself at last into an unproved assumption of its neces·
sity. It has however some advantageS, which need
not be mentioned, over that of Leibnitz 3 and it is
here printed, not as a solution of the greatest mys·
tery of the universe, but as most characteristic of
the author’s mind, original and sublime, uniting,
what is very rare except in early youth, a fearless
and unblenching spirit of inquiry into the highest
objects of speculation‚ with the most humble and
reverential piety. It is probable thatin many of
his views on such topics he was influenced by the
writings of Jonathan Edwards, with whose opinions
on metaphysical and moral subjects, he seems gene-
rally to have concurred.

‘The extract from a review of Tennyson's poems
in a publication now extinct, the Englishman's Maga-
zr'ne, is also printed at the suggestion of a friend.
The pieces that follow are reprints, and have been
already mentioned in this Memoir.'
