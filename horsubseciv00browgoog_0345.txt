Happy Guessz'ng. 331

of the entire mind 3 and whatsoever our hand finds
to d0‚ we must do it with our might. Therefore it
is that this master act of the man, under some
sudden and great unexpected crisis, is in a great
measure performed unconsciously as to its mental
means. The man is so totus in illo, that there is
no bit of the mind left to watch and record the
acts of the rest, therefore men, when they have
done some signal seat of presence of mind, if asked
how they did it, generally don’t very well know--
they just did it: it was, in fact, done and then
thought of, not thought of andthen done, in which
case it would likely never have been done. Not
that the act was uncaused by mind; it is one of
the highest powers of mind thus to act 3 but it is
done, if I may use the phrase, by an acquired in·
stinct. You will find all this in that wonderful old
Greek who was Alexander the Great’s and the old
world's schoolmaster‚ and ours if we were wise‚—
whose truthfulness and clear insight one wonders at
the longer he lives He seems to have seen the
human mind as a bird or an engineer does the earth
—he knew the plan of it. We now-a-days see it as
one sees a country, athwart andin perspective, and
from the side; he saw it from above and from be-
low. There are therefore no shadows, no fore·
shortenings, no clear-obscure, indeed no disturbing
medium, it is as if he examined everything in vacue.
