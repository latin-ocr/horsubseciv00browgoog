362 Horae Subrecivoe,

the packman and the piper made his appearance,
with his stories‚ and jokes, and ballads, his songS,
and reeh, and ‘wauton wiles’

There is one story about him which has always
appeared to me quite perfect A fanner in a remote
part of Galloway, one June morning before sunrise,
was awakened by music; he had been dreaming of
heaven, and when he found himself awake, he still
heard the strains He looked out, and saw no one,
but at the corner of a grass field he saw his cattle,
and young colts and fillies, huddled together, and
looking intently down into what he knew was an old
quarry. He put on his clothes, and walked across
the field, everything but that strange wild melody,
still and silentiu this ‘the sweet hour of prime! As
he got nearer the ‘heasts,' the sound was louder 3 the
colts with their long manes and the uowt with their
wondering stare, took no notice of him, straining
their necks forward entranced. There, in the old
quarry‚ the young sun ‘glintin’ on his face, and
testing on his pack, which had been his pillow, was
our Wandering Willie, playing and singing like an
angel-‘ an Orpheus 3 an Orpheus! What a picture!
When reproved for wasting his health and time by
the prosaic farmer, the poor fellow said: ‘Me and
this quarry are lang aequant, and I’ve mair pleesure
in pipiu' to thae daft cowt5, than if the best leddies
in the land were figurin’ away afore me'
