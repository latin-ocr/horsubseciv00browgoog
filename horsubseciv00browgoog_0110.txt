can hear their hearty talk, can see thern coming and
going between the meeting-house and the Tent on
the side of the burn, and then the Monday dinner,
and the cheerful talk, and the many clerica] stories
and pleasantries, and their going horne on their hardy
little horses, Mr. Comrie leaving his cml-papers till
the next solemnity, and leaving also some j0ke of
his own, clear and compactas a diamond, and as

Iam in Rose Street on the monthly lecture, the
church crammed, passages and pulpit stairs. Exact
to a minute, James Chalmers—the old soldier and
beadle, slim, meek‚ but incorruptible by proffered
halfcrowns from ladies who thus tried to get in
before the doors opened—appears, and all the people
in that long pew rise up, and he, followed by his
minister, erect and engrossed, walks in along the
seat, and they struggle up to the pulpit We all
know what he is to speak of ; he looks troubled
even to distress 3—it is the matter of Uriah the Hit-
tite. He gives out the opening verses of the 51st
Psalm, and offering up a short and abrupt prayer,
which every one takes to himself, announces his
miserable and dreadful subject, sencing it, as it were,
in a low, penetrating voice, daring any one of us to
think an evil thought, there was little need at that
tirne of the warning,-he infused his own intense,
pure spirit, into us all.
