SYDNEY SMITH’s Sketclzer of lecturos on Moral
Philosophy. Second Edition.

SEDcwiCK's Discourse on tlte Studies at Cambridge,
with a Preface and Appendix. Sixth Edition.

We have put these two worthies here, not because
we had forgotten them,-much less because we think
less of thern than the others, especially Sydney;
but because we bring thern in at the end os our
small entertainment, as we hand round a liqueur-
be it Curacoa, Kimmel, or old Glenlivet-after
dinner, and end with the heterogeneous plum-pud·
ding, that most English oi realized ideas. Sydney
Smith's book is one of rare excellence, and well
worthy of the study of men and women, though
perhaps not transcendental enough for our modern
philosophers, male and female. It is really aston-
ishing how much os the best of everything, from
patriotism to nonsense, is to be found in this volume
of sketches. You may read it through, ifyour sides
can bear such an accumulation of laughter‚ with
great benefit; and ifyou open it anywhere, you can’t
read three sentences without coming across some, it
may be common thought, and often original enough,
better expressed and put than you ever before saw it.
