three awakened by a cry of pain-sharp, insufferable,
as if one were stung. Years after we two confided to
each other, sitting by the bumside, that we thought
that ‘great cry' which arose at midnight in Egypt
must have been like it. We all knew whose voice it
was, and, in our night-clothes, we ran into the passage,
and into the little parlour to the left hand, in which
was a closet-bed. We found my father standing be-
fore us, erect, his hands clenched in his black hair, his
eyes sull of misery and amazement, his face white as

’ that of the dead. He frightened us. He saw this, or

else his intense will had mastered his agony, for, taking
his hands from his head, he said, slowly and gently,
‘Let us give thanks,' and turned to a little sosa in the
room, there lay our mother, dead.1 She had' long
been ailing. Ι remember her sitting in a shawl,-
an Indian one with little dark green spots on a light
ground‚—and watching her growing pale with what I
afterwards knew must have been strong pain. She
had, being severish, slipped out of bed, and ‘grand-
mother,' her mother, seeing her ‘change come,' had
called my father, and they two saw her open her blue,
kind, and true eyeS, ‘comfortable’ to us all ‘as the

smells ol flowers and leaves, the tastes os wild sruits-they touch
and awaken the memory in a strange way. ‘Tibbie’ is now
living at Thankerton.

had always beside him. He used to tell us he set ber down
upon it when he brought her horne to the manse.
