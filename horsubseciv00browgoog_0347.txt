Happy Guessz'ng. 333

of that excellent thinker, as well as best of all story-
tellers, Miss Austen‚ when she says in Emma, ‘De-
pend upon it, a lucky guess is never merely luck,
there is always some talent in it,’—talent here denot-
ing intelligence and will in action. In all sciences
except those called exact, this happy guessing plays a
large part, and in none more than in medicine, which
is truly a tentative art, founded upon likelihood, and

to imply that it grows up altogether independent of resson, any
more than Whewell means to say that all the discoveries in the
inductive sciences have been made hymen taking “shots” at
them, as boys at school do at hard passages in their Latin les·
sons On the contrary, no faculty is so absolutely the child of
reason as this faculty of happy guessing. It only attains to per·
fection after the reason has been long and painlully trained in
the spherc in which the guesses are to be made. What Aristotle
does mean is, that when it has attained perfection‚ we are not
conscious ol the share which reason has in its operation-it is so
rapid that by no analysis can we detect the presence of reason
in its action Sir Isaac Newton seeing the apple fall, and
thence ‘⁶ guessing ” at the law os gravitation, is a good instance
of εὐστοχία.

aperception ol the truth, buta perception of how the truthis

readiness or presence of mind is better, as sagacity rather in·
volves the idea of consideration. In matters purely intellectual
it is ready wit Itis a sort of shorter or more limited εὐστοχῐα.
lt is more os a natural gift than εὐστοχία, because the latter is a
far higher and nobler faculty, and therefore more dependent for
its perfection on cultivation, as all our highest faculties are
Εὑστοχὶα is more akin to genius, ἀγχίνοια to practical common
sense
