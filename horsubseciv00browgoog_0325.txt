· Πρῶτον χόρτον, εἶτα στάχυν, εἶτα πλήρη σῖτον ἐν τῷ στάχυϊ.

ONE os the chief sins of our time is hurry: it is

helter-skelter‚ and devii take the hindmost. -

Off we go all too swift at staning, and we neither
run so fast nor so sar as we would have done, had
we taken it connily at first. This is true of a boy as

well as of a blood eolt Not only are boys and
Ι colts made to do the work and the running of full·
grown men and horses, but they are hurried out of
themselves and their now, and pushed into the
middle ol next week where nobody is wanting them,
and beyond which they frequently never get.

The main duty os those who care sor the young
is to secure their wholesome, their entire growth‚ for
health is just the development of the whole natiue
in its due sequences and proportions : first the blade

—then the ear-then, and not till then, the full corn
