an Assistant Master of Eton College. At Eton he con-
tinued till the summer of 1827. He was now become
a good though not perhaps a first-rate scholar in the
Latin and Greek languages. The loss of time, re·
latively to this object, in travelling, but far more his
increasing avidity fora different kind of knowledge,
and the strong bent of his mind to subjects which
exercise other faculties than such as the acquirement
of languages calls into play, will sufficiently account
for what might seem a comparative deficiency in
classical learning. It ean only, however, be reck-
oned one, comparatively to his other attainments,
and to his remarkable facility in mastering the
modern languages. The Editor has thought it not
improper to print in the following pages an Eton
exercise, which, as written before the age of fourteen,
though not free from metrical and other errors,
appears, perhaps to a partial judgment, far above
the level of such compositions. It is remarkable
that he should have selected the story of Ugolino‚
from a poet with whom, and with whose language,
he was then but very slightly acquainted, but who
was afterwards to become, more perhaps than any
other, the master-mover of his spirit It may be
added, that great judgment and taste are perceptible
in this translation, which is by no means a literal
one, and in which the phraseology of Sophocles is
not ill substituted, in some passages, for that of Dante.
