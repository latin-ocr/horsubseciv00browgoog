plicity, a closeness of thought, a glance keen aud
wide, aplay of the entire nature, and a truthfulness
and downrightneSS, with an amount, and accuracy,
and vivification of learning, such as we know of in
no one other writer, ancient or modem-not even
Leibnitz; and we know no writings which so whole-
somely at once exalt and humble the reader, make
him feel what isin him, and what he can and may,
as well as what he cannot, and need never hope to
know. In this respect, Hamilton is as grand as
Pascal, and more simple; he exemplifies everywhere
his own sublime adaptation of Scripture-unless a
man becomea little child, he cannot enter into the
kingdom 3 he enters the temple stooping, buthe
presses on, intrepid and alone, to the inmost adytum,
worshipping the morethe nearer he gets to the in-
accessible shrine, whose veil no mortui hand has
ever rent in twain. And we name after him, the
thoughtful, candid, impressive little volume of his
pupil, his friend, and his successor, Professor Fraser.
