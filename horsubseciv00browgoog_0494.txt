‘ Sleep till the end, true soul and sweet‚
Nothing comes to thee new or strange,
step, fullos rest from head to feet ;
Lie still, dry dust, secure of change'
Vattene in paee, alma beata e bella.-Go in peace, ’
soul beautiful and blessed.
‘O man greatly beloved, go thou thy way till the
end, for thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot at 'the
end of the days.'—Dnn'1m„

‘Lord‚ I have viewed this world over, in which
thou hast set me3 I have tried how this and that
thing will fit my spirit, and the design os my creation
and can find nothing on which to rest, for nothing
here doth itself rest, but such things as please mesor
awhile, in some degree, vanish and flee as shadows
from before me. Lo i Ι come to Thee-the Etemal
Being—the Spring of Life—the Centre of rest—the
Stay of the Creation-the Fulness of all things. Ι
join myself to Thee3 with Thee I will lead my lise,
and spend my days, with whom Ι aim to dwell for
ever, expecting‚ when my little time is over, to be
taken up ere long into thy etemity.'-J011N Hown
The Vanity of Man as Mortal.

Necesse est tanquam immaturam mortem ejus de·
