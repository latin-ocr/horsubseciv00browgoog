trinsic harmony acquired external freedom; but
there arose a violent and unusual action in the
several component functionS, each for itself‚ all
striving to reproduce the regular power which the
whole had once enjoyed. Hence tlte melouclzoly
which so evidently characterizet tte spirit of modern
poetry,· hence that return of the mind upon itself‚
and the habit of secking relief in idiosyncrasies
rather than community of interest. In tlte old times

‘One of the faithful Isletm‚ a poet in the truest
and highest sense, we are anxious to present to our

with the “eruditus oculus,'’ and his ear hos a fairy
fineness. There is o strange contestatos in tis zoor-

passioned song, more easily felt than described, and
not to be escaperl bythose who have once felt it.
