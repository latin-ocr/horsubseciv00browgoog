shepherds have to their dogs Professor Syme one
day, many years ag0, when living in Fortes Street,
was looking out of his window‚ and he saw a young
shepherd striding down North Charlotte Street, as
if making for his house: it was midsummer. The
man had his dog with him, and Mr. Syme noticed
that he followed the dog, and not it him, though
he contrived to steer for the house. He came, and
was ushered into his room 3 he wished advice about
‘some ailment, and Mr. Syme saw that he had abit
of twine round the dog's neck, which he let drop out
of his hand when he entered the room. He asked
him the meaning of this, and he explained that the
magistrates had issued a mad-dog proclamation‚
commanding all dogs to be muzzled or led on pain
of death ‘And why do you go about as Isaw you
did before you came in to mel' ‘Oh‚’ said he,
looking awkward‚ ‘I didna want Birkie to ken he Ι
was tied' Where will you find truer courtesy and
finer feelingl He didn’t want tov hurt Birkie’s
feelings.
