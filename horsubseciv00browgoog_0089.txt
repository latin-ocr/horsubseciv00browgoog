Letter to John Caz'rns, DJ). 7 3

Brougham going to hear him. It is very character·
istic, and as Ι had it from Mrs. Cuninghame, who¹
was present, I may be allowed to tell it. Brougham
and Denman were on a visit to James Stuart of Dun-
eam, about the time of the Queen's trial. They had
asked Stuart where they should go to ehurch ; he said
he would take them to a Seceder minister at Inver-
keithing. They went, and as Mr. Stuart had described
the saintly old man, Brougham said he would like to
be introduced to him, and arriving before service
time, Mr. Stuart called, and left a message that some
gentlemen wished to see him. The answer was that
‘Maister' Brown saw nobody before divine worship.
He then sentin Brougham and Denman's names.
‘Mr Brown’s compliments to Mr. Stuart, and he
sees nobody before sermon,' and in a few minutes
out came the stooping shy old man, and passed them,
unconscious of their presence. They sat in the front
gallery, and he preached a faithful sermon, full of fire
and of native force. They came away greatly moved,
and each wrote to Lord Jeffrey to lose not a week in
coming to hear the greatest natural orator they had
ever heard. Jeffrey came next Sunday, and often
after declared he never heard such words, such a
sacred, untaught gift of speech. Nothing was more
beautiful than my father’s admiration and emotion
when listening to his uncle's rapt passages, or than
his childlike faith in my father’s exegetical prowess.
