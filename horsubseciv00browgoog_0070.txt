My father’s union with Miss Crum was not only
one of the best blessings of his life,-itmadehin1
more of a blessing to others, than it is likely he
would otherwise have been. By her cheerful, gra·
cious ways, her love for society as distinguished from
company, her gift of making every one happy and at
ease when with her, and her tender compassion for
all suffering, she in a measure won my father from
himself and his books, to his own great good, and
to the delight and benefit of us all It was like sun·
shine and a glad sound in the house. She succeeded
in what is called ‘drawing out’ the inveterate soli·
tary. Moreover, she encouraged and enabled him
to give up a moiety of his ministerial laboum, and
thus to devote himself to the great work of his
later years, the preparing for and giving to the press
the results of his life's study of God's Word We
owe entirely to her that immense armamentarium
libertatis, the third edition of his treatise on Civil
Obedience.
