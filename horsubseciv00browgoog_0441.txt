Arlhur H. Hallam. 427

we trust, profit from—The Remains in Versa and
Prose, of Arthur Henry Hallam, 18343 privately
printed. We had sor many years been searching
for this volume, but in vain ; asentence quoted by
Henry Taylor struck us, and our desire was quick-
ened by reading In Memoriam. We do not remem-
ber when we have been more impressed than by
these Remains of this young man, especially when
taken along with his friend's Memorial; and instead
of trying to tell our readers what this impression is,
we have preferred giving them as copious extracts
as our space allows, that they may judge and enjoy

for themselves. The italics are our own. We can·
promise them few finer, deeper, and better pleasures
than reading, and detaining their minds over these
two books together, filling their hearts with the ful-
ness of their tmth and tendemess. They will see
how accurate as well as how affectionate and ‘ol
imagination all compact' Tennyson 13, and how
worthy of all that he has said of him, that friend
was. The likeness is drawn ad vz'vum,

‘When to the sessions os sweet silent thought
He summons up remembrance of things past’

‘The idea of his Life’ has been sown a natural
body, and has been raised aspiritual body, but the
identity is unhurt ; the countenance shines and the
raiment is white and glistering, but itis the same
face and form.
