wisdom entertth not into a malicious mind, and that knowledge
without conscience is but the ruin of the saul ; it behoueth thieto

‘ Qui curionis postulat totum sua
Patere menti, ferre qui non sufficit
Mediocritates conscientiam sico,

Judcx tnt'qnus, astimatorest malus
Suique naturaque ; nam mmm parens,
Libanda tantum qua uern't mortalibus,
Nos scire pauca, multo mirari jubet.'
