Noteson Art.v 267

Napoleon is represented as alone-seated lrur·
riedly and sideways upon a chair-one leg of which
has trod upon a magnificent curtain, and is trailing it
down to ruin He is dressed in his immortal grey
coar, his leather breeches, and his big riding hoots,
soiled with trave13 the shapely little feet, os which he
was so proud‚ are drawn comfortlessly in3 his hat
is thrown on the ground His attitude is that ol the
deepest deJ'ection and abstraction3 his body is sunk‚
and his head seems to bear it down, with its burden
of trouble. This is finely indicated hythe deep
transverse sold of his waistcoat3 one arm is across the
back of the chair, the other on his knee, his plump
hands lying idle; his hair, that thin, black straight
hair, looks wet, and lies wildly across his immense
forehead. But the face is where the artist has set
his highest impress, and the eyes are the wonder of
his face. The mouth is firm as ever—beautiful and
unimpassioned as an insant’s3 the cheeks plump, the
features expressive of weariness, but not distressed3
the brow looming out from the dark hair, like some-
thing oppressively and supematurally capacious ζ and
then the eyes! his whole mindlooking through
them,—bodi1y distress, want of sleep, sear, doubt,
shanre, astonishment, anger, speculation, secking rest
butas yet finding it not 3 going over all possibilities,
