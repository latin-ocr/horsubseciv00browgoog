Among the modern poets, Byron was at this time,
far above the rest, and almost exclusively, his
favourite; a preference which, in later years, he
transferred altogether to Wordsworth and Shelley.
‘He became, when about fifteen years old, a
member of the debating society established among
the elder boys, in which he took great interest, and
this served to confirm the bias of his intellect to
wards the moral and political philosophy of modern
times. It was probably, however, of important utility
in giving him that command of his own language
which he possessed, as the following Essays will
show, in a very superior degree, and in exercising
those powers of argumentative discussion, which now
displayed themselves as eminently characteristic of
his mind. It was a necessary consequence that he
declined still more from the usual paths of study,
and abated perhaps somewhat of his regard for the
writers of antiquity. It must not be understood,
nevertheless, as most of those who read these pages
will be aware, that he ever lost his sensibility to
those ever-living effusions of genius which the ancient
languages preserve. He loved AEschylus and So

phocles (to Euripides he hardly did justice), Lucre- i

tius and Virgil ; if he did not seem so much drawn
towards Homer as might at first be expected, this
may probably be accounted for by his increasing
taste for philosophical poetry.
