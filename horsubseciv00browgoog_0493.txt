Thus it is, that to each one of us the death of
Arthur Hallam—his thoughts and affections—his
views of God, of our relations to Him, of duty, of
the meaning and worth of this world and the next,-
where he now is, have an individual significance.

Will never come back to me’

And the sound ol a voice that is still l’

‘ God gives us love! Something to love
He lends us ; but when love is grown
To ripeness‚ that on which it throve
Falls off, and love is leit alone z

⁴ This is the curse os time. Alas!
In gries we are not all unlearned ;
Once, through our own doors Death did pass 5
One went, who never hath retnmed

‘This star
Rose with us, through a little arc
of heaven, nor having wandered sar,
Shot on the sudden into dark.

‘ Sleep sweetly, tender beart, in peace 3
SIeep, holy spirit, blessed soul, ¹
While the stars burn, the moons increase
And the great ages onward roll.
