Preface. vii

‘Dn John Brown, D.D.‚ was a native of Brooklyn,
in this State. He was settled at one time in Caze-
novia New York‚ and finally died at the age of fifty,
prematurely worn out, at Hadley, Mass. He was a
κ man of great tenacity of purpose, strength of intelleet‚

a clear thinker‚ and generally a powerful man. He
was also much beloved‚ for his heart was large and
warm.

‘While he was waiting for death to overtake him,
being undermined as I have said, I have heard my

mother say that he once remarked‚ “I have worn

mysels out in labour which God never required of
me, and for which man never will thank me.’'’

Those of my readers who think life in the main
more serious than not, will forgive this grave and
weighty passage. Those who do not think so, will
nothe the worse of asking themselves if they are safe
in so doing.
