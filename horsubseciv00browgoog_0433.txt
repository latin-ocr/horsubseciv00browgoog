ARTHUR H. HALLAM.

ΙΝ the chancel of Clevedon Church, Somerset-
shire, rest the mortal remains of Arthur Henry
Hallam, eldest son of our great philosophie histo-
rian and critic‚'—and the friend to whom ln Memo-
riam is sacred. This place was selected by his
father, not only from the connexion of kindred,
being the burial-place of his maternal grandfather,
Sir Abraham Elton, but likewise ‘on account of its
still and sequestered situation, on a lone hill that
overhangs the Bristol Channel.' That lone hill, with
its humble old church, its outloolr over the waste of
waters, where ‘the stately ships go on,’ was, we
doubt not, in Tennyson's mind, when the poem,
‘Break, break, break,' which contains the burden of
that volume in which are enshrined so much of the
‹leepest affection, poetry, philosophy, and godliness
rose into his ‘study of imagination ’-‘ into the eye
and prospect of his soul.’¹
