THE BLACK DWARF'S BONES.

THESE gnarled, stunted‚ useless old bones,
were all that David Ritchie‚ the original of the
Black Dwarf, had sor left femur and tibia, and we

have merely to look at them, and add poverty‚ te
know the misery summed up in their possession.

They seem to have been blighted and ri'ckety.
