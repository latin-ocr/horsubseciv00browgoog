The Black Dwars ’s Bona. 357

But he drew a score‚ himsel' did sain,

The auld wife tried, but her tongue was gane ;

While the young aue closer clespit her wean‚
And turn’d frae Ancon-dmm.

But the canty auld wife cam till her brath,
And she thocht the Bible might ward aff skaith3
Be it benshee‚ bogle, ghaist, or wraith-

But it feard na' thilen-(irum.

‘His presence protect us 1’ quoth the auld gudeman3

‘What wad ye, where won ye,-by sea or by lan’?

Ι conjure ye-speak-by the Beuk in my han’ !'
What a grane gae Aiken-drum!

‘ 1 lived in a lan' whar we saw nae sky,

I dwalt in a spot whar a burn rins na by ς

But I’se dwall noo wi’ you if ye like to try — ·

‘I'll shiel a’ your sheep i’ the mornin’ sune,¹

I'll berry your crap by the licht o’ the moon,
An' ba the baims wi’ an unkenn'd tune,

‘I’ll loup the linn when ye canna wude,

I’ll kirn the kim, and I’ll turn the bread3

An’ the wildest fillie that e’er can rede
I’se tame’tss quoth Aikeu-drum.

To gather the dew frae the heather-bell-

1 On one occasion, Bromie had undertaken to gather the sheep into the
bught hyan early hour, and so zealously did he perform his task, that not
only was there not one sheep left on the hill, but he had also collected a
number of hares, which were found fairly penned along with rhem. Upon
being congratulated on his extraordinary success, Brownie exclaimed‚
‘Confoond thae wee gray anes 1 they cost me mair trouble than a' the lave
ο· them!
