‘With Brains, Sir! 401 ’

mend to those who wish to understand thoroughly,
and to make up their minds, on these great subjects
as wholes3 but we all know too well that our Art is
long, broad, and deep,-and Time, opportunity, and
our little hour, brief and uncertain, therefore, we
would recommend those books as a sort of game of
the mind, a mental exercise—like cricket, a gym-
nastic, a clearing of the eyes of their mind as with
euphrasy, a strengthening their power over particu-
lars, a getting fresh, strong views of worn out, old
things, and, above all, a learning the right use of their
reason, and by knowing their own ignorance and
weakness, finding true knowledge and strength. Tak-
ing up a book like Amauld, and reading a chapter
of his lively, manly sense, is like throwing your
manuals, and scalpels, and microscopes, and natural
(most unnatural) orders out of your hand and head,
and taking a game with the Grange Club, or a run
to the top of Arthur Seat. Exertion quickens your ·
pulse, expands your lungs, makes your blood warmer
and redder, fills your mouth with the pure waters
of relish, strengthens and supples your legs 3 and
though on your way to the top you may encounter
rocks, and baffling dibris, and gusts of fierce winds
rushing out upon you from behind comers, just as
you will find in Amauld, and all truly serious and
honest books of the kind, difficulties and puzzles,
winds of doctrine, and deceitful mists ; still you are
ac.
