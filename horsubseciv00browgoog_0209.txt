with his dog, when he found we had wakened‚ told
us there was four inches of snow‚ and we soon saw
it was too nue. So we had to go home without our
, cryptogamic prize.

It turned out that Adam, who was an old man
and hail, and had made some money, was going at
Whitsunday to leave, and live with his son in Glas·
gow. We had been admiring the beauty and gentle-
ness and perfect shape os Wylie‚ the finest collie Ι
ever s'aw, and said, ‘What are you going to do with
Wyliel’ ‘'Deed,’ says he, ‘I hardly ken. Ι canna
think o’ selling her, though she's worth four pound‚
and she ’ll no like the toun.' I said, ‘Would you
let me have her l’ and Adam, looking at her fondly,
—she came up instantly to him, and made os him--
said, ‘Ay‚ Ι wull‚ if ye'll be gude to her3’ and it
was settled that when Adam left for Glasgow she
should be sent into Albany Street by the carrier.

She came, and was at once taken to all our hearts
-even grandmother liked her 3 and though she was
often pensive, as if thinking ol her master and her
work on the hills, she made herself at home, and
behaved in all respects like a lady. When out with
me, il she saw sheep in the streets or mad, she
got quite exeited, and helped the work, and was
curiously useful‚ the being so making her wonder-
fully happy. And so her little life went on, never
doing wrong, always blithe and kind and beautiful.
