88 H orae ,subseciva

We question if as many carefully thought and
worded, and rapidly and by no means laboriously
written sermons, were composed anywhere else in
Britain during his fifty years—every Sunday two new
ones 3 the composition saultless-such as Cicero or
Addison would have made them, had they been U.P.
ministers 3 only there was always in thern more soul
than body, more ol the spirit than of the letter.
What a contrast to the much turbid‚ hot, hasty,
perilous stuff of our day and preachers! ‘lhe
original power and siae os Dr. Henderson's mind,
his roominess for all thoughts, and his still reserve,
his lentitude, made, as we have said, his expressions
clear and quiet, to a degree that a coarse and care-
less man, spoiled hy the violence and noise of other
pulpit men, might think insipid. But let him go over
the words slowly, and he would not say this again;
and let him see and feel the solemnizing, command-
ing power of that large, square, leonine countenance,

even electrical He became rapt and excited as with new in·
spiration ; his utterance grew thick and rapid ; his voice trembled
and {altered with emotion 3 his eye gleamed witha wild unearthly
lustre‚ in which his countenance shared3 and his whole frame
heaved to and fro, as is each glowing thought and vivid figure
that followed iu quick succession were only a fragment os some
greater revelation which he panted to overtake Τὴε writer ol
this notice has witnessed nothing similar in any preacher, and
numbers the effects oi a passage which he onoe heard upon the
soenes and exercises os the heavenly world among his most
thrilling recollections of sacred oratory.’-Memoir prthad to
