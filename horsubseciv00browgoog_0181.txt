HER LAST HALF-CROWN.

‘ Once I hadsnhtds-though now by all fhrsaken :
once I ltadpannts—tltff are now in heaven.
I had a home once—’

Worn out with anguirh, sin, and cold, and hunger,
Dotem sunk tlte outcast, death had sez'zcd her senses.
There did the stmnger find her in tlte morning--
God had mleased her.
