‘As he was os the Pauline type os mind, his Christianity mn
into the same mould. A strong, interne, and vehement natan,
zoeth masculine intellect and unyiclding wt'll, he accepted the Bihlc
in its liteml simplicity os an absolute revelation, and then shoaed
the strength os his character in suh'ugating his whole being to this
decism influence, and in projecting the someconnictions into other
minds. Hc was a heliever in the scnseof the old Puritans, and,
amid the doubt ond scepticism os the nineteenth century, holdas
finnly as any osthern hythe doctrines osatonement ond graec. He
had most of the idiosyncmsy os Baxter, though not without thc
contemplation of Howc. the doctrim eff Calvenism, mitigatcd
laet not nnmenceal, ond recemed simply as dictata os Heoven, zor'th·
out any cffirrt or hope to brodgc ooer their inscrutahle depthsby
philosophicol theorias, he translated into a servent, huntble, and
msolutely octone life.

‘ Yhere was asonntoin cefmtderncss in his nature os well aso
sweep asempetnom indigentiam and the one drawn out, and the
other contmlled byhis Christianfieith made him at oncea philon-
thropist ond a eesormer, and both in the highest departmentsos
human interest. Yhe uneon os these arderet elenunts, ond os o
highly denotional temperament, not untouched with melancholy,
with the potienceof the scholar, and thesobriety of the critic, fhrmcd
the singulority and almost the anornoly os his personal character.
These contmsts were tempercd by the discipline ofexperience‚· and
his life, both as a mon ond a Chnstean, seemcd to become mon
neh, gemat, ond harmoniam as it approoched its doses—Da.
