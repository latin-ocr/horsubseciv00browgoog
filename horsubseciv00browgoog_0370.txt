His face did glow like the glow 0’ the west,

When the drumlie cloud has it half o'ercast3

Or the struggling moon when she’s sair distroet,
O Sirsl ’twas thilen-dmm.

Ι trow the bauldest stood abach,
Wi' agape an' aglow’r till their lugs did crach,
As the shapeless phantom mum'ling spak,

Hae ye wark for Aiken·drum?

01 had ye seen the baims’s fricht,

As they stared at this wild and unyirthy wicht,

As they skulkit in ’tween the dark an’ the licht‚
An' graned out, Aiken·drum!

‘ Saus us l' quoth Jock, ‘d’ye see sick eenl'
Cn'es Kate, ‘There ’s a hole where a nose should ha' been ς
An' the mouth’s like a gash that a horn had ri’en ;

Wow! keep's fraeAilren·drum!'

The black dog growlin’ cow’ red his tail,

Τὴε lassie swarf’d‚ loot sa’ the pail ;

Rob’s lingle brack as he mendit the hail,
At the sicht 0’ Aiken-drum.

His matted head on his breast did rest,

A lang blue heard wan’ered down like a vest ;

But the glare o’ his e’e hath nae bard exprest,
Nor the skimes o’ Ailren-drunn

Roun’ his hairy form there was naething seen,

But a philebeg o’ the rashes green,

An' his knotted knees played aye knoit between ;
What a sicht was Aiken·drum!

On his wauchie arms three claws did meet,
As they trail’d on the grun' by his taeless seet3
E'en the auld gudeman himsel' did sweat,

To look at thilen-dmm„
