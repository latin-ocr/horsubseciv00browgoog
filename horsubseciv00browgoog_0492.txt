478 Horra Subsecioae.

There is a sad pleasure,-non ingrata amaritudo,
and a sort of meditative tenderness in contemplating
the little life of this ‘dear youth,’ and in letting the
mind rest upon these his earnest thoughts, to watch
his licen and fearless, but childlike spirit, moving
itself aright—going straight onward along ‘the lines
of limitless desires’—throwing himself into the very
deepest of the ways of God, and striking out asa
strong swimmer striketh out his hands to swim3 to
see him ‘mewing his mighty youth, and kindling
his undazzled eye at the fountain itself of heavenly
radiance :’

Light intellectual, and full os love,
Love os true beauty, therefore full of joy,
J0y, every other sweetness far above’

It is good for every one to look upon such a sight,
and as we look, to love. We should all be the
better for it; and should desire to be thankful for,
and to use aright a gift so good and perfect, coming
down as it does from above, from the Father of

one foresight nor the other 3 and as pain has been truly said to
be ‘⁴ the deepest thing in our nature,” so is it sear that will bring
the depths of our nature within our knowledge A great >capu·
city of rufflrr'ng belongs to genius ; and it hasbeen observed that
an alternation of joyfulness and dejection isquite as character·
istic of the rnan of genius as intensiry in either kind.’ In his
Notis smm Books, p. 216, he recurs to it ιω* “Pain,” saysa
writer whose early death will not prevent his being long remem-
bered, ‘⁴ pain is the deepest thing that we have in our nature, and
union through pain has always seemed more real and more holy
than any other.” ’
