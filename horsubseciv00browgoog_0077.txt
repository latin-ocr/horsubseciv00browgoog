Latiar to'Jolzn Caz'rns, m. 61

conditions under which he lived were the love, the
pursuit, and the practice os truth in everytlring3
strength and depth, rather than external warmth of
affection 3 fidelity to principles and to friends. He
used often to speak of themora] obligation laid upon
every man to think truly, as well as to speak and act

two senses, it was impossible it could have any sense at ell,'' itis
plain, we think, that he forgot the specific character ot' pro·
phetic literature, via, its being in the highest degree poetic.
Now every one knows that poetry of a very elevated cast almost
invariably possesses great breadth, variety, we may say multi·
plicity os meaning. Its very excellence consists in its being
capable os two three, or many meanings and applications. Take.
